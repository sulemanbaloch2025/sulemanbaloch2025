Rising Sophomore at DePauw University aspiring to become a Software Engineer. I stem from Pakistan and am currently pursuing my Bachelors in Arts
degree in Computer Science in the US. I enjoy learning almost everything related to technology. My main passion in life is to become a full-stack developer. I am experienced 
at front-end development and currently focusing on learning back-end tools. I have worked with HTML, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, 
React, Node, Redux, and UIs.
